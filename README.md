NPC: NanoPeakCell
==================
HitFinder and Peak-Picking in Serial Crystallography experiments.

NPC is a python software designed to select the good from the bad 
in serial crystallography experiments (both at synchrotrons or XFELs)


NPC relies on (installation with gcc is recommended):
====================================================

fabio:    https://github.com/kif/fabio
pyFAI:    https://github.com/kif/pyFAI
pyopencl: https://github.com/pyopencl/pyopencl
HDF5:     http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
h5py:     https://github.com/h5py/h5py
PIL:      http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/#pil117 (download the source kit)

(except for fabio and pyFAI, all other packages are available as ports in MacPorts)

ans also on various python modules:
===================================
wxpython - matplotlib - numpy - pubsub (but this is standard - isnt'it ?)
If not, using MacProts remains the way to go...
(a port is now available for crystFEL)
